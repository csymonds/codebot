This is a chatGPT bot with long term memory using Pinecone

It also uses the Whisper API to do speech to text


## Setup

1. If you donâ€™t have Python installed, [install it from here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    

    You will need to create an account on [Pinecone and follow their registration procedures](https://www.pinecone.io/).

    Pinecone also has [documentation you can follow for integration with OpenAI](https://docs.pinecone.io/docs/openai) if you want to try your own.

    Documentation for the [OpenAI chatGPT API is available here.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries)

2. Clone this repository

   ```bash
   $ git clone git@github.com:csymonds/codebot.git
   ```

3. Navigate into the project directory
   
   ```bash
   $ cd codebot
   ```
## Virtual environment and dependency installation
4. Virtualize (Note: Windows users will see `venv/Scripts/activate`)
   ```
   $ python -m venv venv
   $ . venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. Install the library dependencies
   ```bash
   $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   In addition to the library dependencies, there are some additional runtime dependencies like pytorch
   
   The below install version assumes you have CUDA 11.7 installed. 
   
   The [necessary CUDA installers are found here.](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone)
   
   Additional [PyTorch installers are found here.](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

   ```bash
   $ pip3 install keyboard torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
   ```

6. Add keys

   Step 1: Make a copy of the example environment variables files

   ```bash
   $ cp example_key_openai.txt key_openai.txt
   $ cp example_key_pinecone.txt key_pinecone.txt
   ```

   Step 2: Copy in your key to the respective file

      Add your [OpenAI API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) to the newly created `key_openai.txt` file
    
      Add your [Pinecone API key](https://docs.pinecone.io/docs/quickstart#2-get-and-verify-your-pinecone-api-key) to the newly created `key_pinecone.txt` file

7. Deactivate
   ```
   $ deactivate
   ```


Tips: sounddevice defaults to your default communications devices in order to record/playback 

To check/modify what those defaults are, use

   ```bash
   python -m sounddevice
   ```

PLEASE NOTE: You will get a warning about model parameters missing when you run this. It is harmless, and can be suppressed by setting the `ignore_warnings` parameter to `True`
